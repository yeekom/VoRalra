  - Basically this feature allows you to join anyone with their joins on or whose on ur friends list instantly.

# Known incompatibilies
<details>
  <summary>Expand</summary>
  
- **The hidden games of groups bugs out a bit if you use [RoSeal](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/roseal-augmented-roblox-e/hfjngafpndganmdggnapblamgbfjhnof?hl=en) with the "Seamless navigation of communities" setting on.**

- **Some servers might not show like France (Might actually be cuz Roblox either change the servers ip or stopped running them)**

- **If you are located in the US the Best Ping button wont work. Dw there is a warning if you press it just in case**
